#Courina

/*Problematic*/ :
Confronting the Coronavirus, and with the lack of technical capabilities, our country had two major problems. The first is there are a lot of people who have innovative ideas but they don't have  the skills or the materials needed to develop them, while the others want to provide help whether they got skills or materials but they don't know who/how to collaborate with. The second problem is people's awareness: These days people are spreading a lot of fake news on social media on the other hand people until the moment didn't get used to the ways of preventions.

//Solution :
COURINA is a mobile application that bands together innovative ideas with skilled people and those who provides materials. In addition, we allocated a reminder to aware people about adhering to the rules of prevention for each hour as most doctors recommend and every time the user change its location or try to get out side. Also, the users can find the official statistics and news about the virus. 
with the implementation of the "Reclamation" feature users can now kill any doubt and send their data (blood type,sexe,symptoms..) which will be protected as well reviewed by volunteer from doctors to anyone who can offer help due contacting them with a simple click.
Among the previous features a corona virus test finds place in this app, which will allow user to check his temperture, cough degree and oher symptoms to check out his current state (this part of the app didnt have a lot of focus yet but it will be done soon), not only that but the state will be saved a list wich will help doctors have more infos and data about the user in case he got infected.
